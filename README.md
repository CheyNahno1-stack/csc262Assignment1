GUI Testing practice for an number generator 
Guidelines
Create a GUI program that allows the user to enter a # that must be Greater than 0 and Less than 10,000. Create an array of integers that is the size that the user entered (e.g., if the user enters 100, the array size will be 100). Generate random numbers and fill the array with these numbers. Use performance timing to time how long it takes to generate and store these numbers. Use performance timing to time how long it takes to sort the array.All variable names should start with Z. Hint - Array.Sort(nameofarray);

Expectations
Create a GUI that allows input of a number between 1 and 10,000.
Create an array of integers where the size is based on the number that the user inputs.
Generate random numbers to fill the array.
Use performance timing to see how long it takes to generate the numbers. (Hint, if your timing is very fast because you are using a high-powered computer, consider increasing the maximum size of the array.)
Use performance timing to see how long it takes to sort the numbers. 
Over-comment the code to show your understanding of C# and the intent of your application.
Make sure to screen record the performance testing and provide it in your video demonstration.
